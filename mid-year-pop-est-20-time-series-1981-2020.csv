"1) Population estimates from years 1981 to 2001 are based on the 1995 Council areas, years 2002 to 2018 are based on the 2011 Council areas and estimates for 2019 onwards are based on the 2019 Council areas. The 2019 areas differ from the previous areas due to a boundary change at Cardowan by Stepps, between Glasgow and North Lanarkshire.
